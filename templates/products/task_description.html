                        Imagine that you have a good friend who will have a birthday next week.
                        But you were very busy and have not yet bought a gift.
                        Crossing the street, you suddenly saw a running person in shoes, which your friend loves.
                        The person was running so fast that you did not have time to take a picture of these shoes.
                        Now you want to buy the similar shoes in the online store to your friend as a gift.
